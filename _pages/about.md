About Me
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjg3LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html).

My current research focuses on **multi-sensor scene understanding in adverse weather conditions**. Specifically, I work on multi-modal fusion for robust semantic understanding of driving scenes. I am part of the EFCL project on [Sensor Fusion](https://efcl.vision.ee.ethz.ch/), where we develop adaptive sensor fusion architectures for high-level visual perception.

Before joining the Computer Vision Lab, I received an MSc in "Robotics, Systems and Control" and a BSc in "Mechanical Engineering", both from ETH Zurich.
